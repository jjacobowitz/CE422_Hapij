## What is CE422?
CE422, also known as "Finite Element Methods", is a graduate-level FEM elective course at The Cooper Union ([syllabus](CE422_syllabus.pdf)). The class teaches the concepts behind FEM, going into detail about the calculations, methods, and element types used for linear, elastic FEM analysis. I took this course during the Fall 2021 semester (my senior year) to learn more about the field of FEM and better understand what is happening "under the hood" of FEM codes I use, such as Ansys APDL. The topics covered in this course were:
* Review of Linear Theory of Elasticity 
* Matrix Structural Analysis 
* Strong (Classical) Form vs. Weak (Variational) Form 
* Rayleigh Ritz and Galerkin Method 
* Finite Element Form of Rayleigh Ritz Method, including: 1D Elements and Basic Elements 
* Lagrange Interpolation Functions 
* Isoparametric Elements 
* Gauss Quadrature

## What code is here?
This repo contains my code for [project 1](Project1) and [project 2](Project2), which served as hand calculations in support of my Ansys APDL structural simulations. For both projects, I include the assignments and my write-ups. This repo also contains my code for solving one of the [midterm](Midterm) exam problems.

## Credits
All the code presented in this repo is my own work.
